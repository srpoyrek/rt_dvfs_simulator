# rt_dvfs_simulator
Simulation and Comparison Real-Time DVFS scheduling algorithms. Implemented the RT-DVFS scheduling algorithms static voltage scaling and the cycle conserving. Both the techniques were EDF based scheduling and were implemented in python. Compared and evaluated both the scheduling techniques on energy consumption for different test cases 
Power and energy are one of the major constraints of real-time embedded systems. Efforts are being made to reduce the power consumed in the real time system, instead of increasing the battery capacity. Power aware scheduling can be the solution to reduce the energy consumption in such cases. This paper provides information about the power performance trade-off in the CMOS devices which forms the basis of the power-aware scheduling techniques. An overview of the voltage and frequency scaling based power-aware scheduling is provided.
